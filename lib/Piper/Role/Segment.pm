=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role contains attributes and methods that apply to each pipeline segment, both individual process handlers (L<Piper::Process>) and pipelines (L<Piper>).

=head1 REQUIRES

=head2 init

This role requires the definition of an C<init> method which initializes the segment as a pipeline instance and prepares it for data processing.  The method must return the created pipeline instance.

=cut

requires 'init';

around init => sub {
    my ($orig, $self, @args) = @_;
    state $call = 0;
    $call++;
    # The first time this is called (per Piper object)
    #   will be from the main (or top-level) pipeline
    #   segment
    my $main = $call == 1 ? 1 : 0;

    my $instance = $self->$orig();

    if ($main) {
        # Set the args in the main instance
        $instance->_set_args(\@args);

        # Reset $call so any other Piper objects can
        #   determine their main segment
        $call = 0;
    }

    return $instance;
};

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 allow

An optional coderef used to subset the items which are I<allowed> to be processed by the segment.

The coderef runs on each item attempting to queue to the segment.  If it returns true, the item is queued.  Otherwise, the item skips the segment and proceeds to the next adjacent segment.

Each item is localized to C<$_>, and is also passed in as the first argument.  These example C<allow> subroutines are equivalent:

    # This segment only accepts digit inputs
    sub { /^\d+$/ }
    sub { $_ =~ /^\d+$/ }
    sub { $_[0] =~ /^\d+$/ }

=cut

has allow => (
    is => 'ro',
    isa => CodeRef,
    # Closure to enable sub to use $_ instead of $_[0],
    #   though $_[0] will also work
    coerce => sub {
        my $orig = shift;
        CodeRef->assert_valid($orig);
        return sub {
            my $item = shift;
            local $_ = $item;
            $orig->($item);
        };
    },
    predicate => 1,
);

=head2 batch_size

The number of items to process at a time for the segment.  Once initialized, a segment inherits the C<batch_size> of its parent(s) if not provided.

=cut

has batch_size => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => PositiveInt,
    required => 0,
    predicate => 1,
    clearer => 1,
);

=head2 config

A L<Piper::Config> object defining component classes and global defaults.

This attribute is set according to the import options provided to S<C<use Piper>>.

=cut

has config => (
    is => 'lazy',
    isa => InstanceOf['Piper::Config'],
    builder => sub { require Piper::Config; return Piper::Config->new() },
);

=head2 debug

Debug level for this segment.

=cut

has debug => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => PositiveOrZeroNum,
    required => 0,
    predicate => 1,
    clearer => 1,
);

=head2 enabled

Boolean indicating that the segment is enabled and can accept items for processing.  Defaults to true.

=cut

has enabled => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => Bool,
    coerce => sub { $_[0] ? 1 : 0 },
    required => 0,
    predicate => 1,
    clearer => 1,
);

=head2 id

A globally unique ID for the segment.  This is primarily useful for debugging only.

=cut

has id => (
    is => 'ro',
    isa => NonEmptySimpleStr,
    builder => sub {
        my ($self) = @_;
        state $id = {};
        my $base = ref $self;
        $id->{$base}++;
        return "$base$id->{$base}";
    },
);

=head2 label

A label for this segment.  If no label is provided, the segment's id will be used.

Labels are necessary if any handlers wish to use the C<injectAt> or C<injectAfter> methods (described in L<Piper> or L<Piper::Process> documentation).  Otherwise, labels are primarily useful for logging and/or debugging (see L<Piper::Logger>).

=cut

has label => (
    is => 'rwp',
    isa => NonEmptySimpleStr,
    lazy => 1,
    builder => sub {
        my $self = shift;
        return $self->id;
    },
);

=head2 verbose

Verbosity level for this segment.

=cut

has verbose => (
    is => 'rw',
    isa => PositiveOrZeroNum,
    required => 0,
    predicate => 1,
    clearer => 1,
);
